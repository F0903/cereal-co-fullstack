# Cereal Co. Week 10-11 Fullstack Project

The Cereal Co. week 10-11 fullstack assignment of Specialisterne. Made with Rust and Svelte.

## Running

To run the project, you can configure and start both backend and frontend as specified in their READMEs. You must also have a database (such as MySQL) running in the background. Alternatively, you can run it with Docker compose.

> Remember to set `.env` files

### Building Docker compose stack

Make sure to set the required environment variables in both **backend** and **frontend** in a `.docker.env` file, NOT the normal `.env`.

Then you can run `docker compose up --build`
